# Title
**Who Americans Spend Their Time With, by Age**

## Step one: the visualization

I chose this visualization because it shows how Americans spend time with different social groups across age. While the data is rich, the chart is visually crowded and hard to interpret. I wanted to simplify the message and highlight a meaningful contrast.

## Step two: the critique
Too many lines made it hard to compare relationships.
The chart lacked focus and visual clarity.
It was informative but not perceptually effective.

## Step three: Sketch a solution
I sketched a simplified version focusing only on partners vs. co-workers. I planned to use a split-axis layout to show contrast clearly.

## Step four: Test the solution

After sketching my redesigned visualization, I shared it with two classmates and asked them a few open-ended questions to understand how they interpreted it.

I started by asking, “Can you tell me what you think this is?” With out explaining the visualization for them. 
They both knew what visualization shows. That was a good sign as it meant the core message was coming through. Next, I asked, “What is this telling you?” They both noticed the same pattern: younger people spend more time with coworkers, but as they age, time with partners increases. One of them pointed out the crossover around middle age and said, “That’s interesting—it’s like a shift in priorities.” When I asked if anything was confusing, one person said it was very clear, while the other suggested adding labels at key ages to make the transition points more obvious. I also asked, “Who do you think is the intended audience?” They both said probably for the general public or students or anyone curious about social behavior and life stages. Finally, I asked, “Is there anything you would change?” One person suggested adding annotations to highlight key insights, and the other recommended using stronger color contrast to make the categories pop more. From there feedback, I learned that the visualization was easy to understand and visually effective, but could be improved with small tweaks like clearer labels and more visual emphasis. I used this input to refine the final version—adjusting the colors and considering annotations to make the message even stronger.


## Step five: build the solution

Title: Average Time Americans Spent With Their Partner vs. Their Co-Workers
This chart compares time spent with partners (positive axis) and coworkers (negative axis) across age. It highlights a life transition where personal relationships begin to dominate over professional ones.
Summary of the process:
I started with a broad chart, narrowed the focus, tested a sketch, and built a clean, intuitive redesign in Tableau. The final result is easier to interpret and more engaging.
